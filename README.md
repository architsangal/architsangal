I am from India. I enjoy listening to music, playing badminton, and travelling. I am fluent in Hindi and English but can only write in English. I like to call myself a Fullstack Flutter Developer. I have built many applications with flutter and native using native android with java with backend in Firebase. I'm always looking to learn something new.
